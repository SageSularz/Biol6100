# First header (largest)

Back to plain text here

## Second level header

### Third level header

Use asterisks for *italic* and double astericks for **boldface** text. 
Use caret for ^superscript^ and ~subscript~ and two tildas for ~~strikethrough~~

> Use a greater than sign for intended quoted material.
Looks Nice!

## For lists
- first item
- second item 
  + Indented list item
  
links [linking text](website address)

**Tables** <br>

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

### Fencing options

Use a single tick for `in line fencing` of material.

Use triple back ticks for a fenced block of text. 

```
everything here is plain text 
even with markdown *commands*

blank lines 


properly spaced

```

Use r in an in-line text:
the value of pi is `r pi + 10`.

## Use chunks for r code

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# r code can be used here!

print(runif(10))
plot(runif(10),runif(10))


```



### Using LaTeX for math 

Use a single dollar sign $a = b + c$ to insert 
mathematical statements within sentences of plain text

In contrast, use a double dollar sign: 

$$a = b + c$$

to center and offset equations.

$$H_0 = Z_{a + b}$$

$$S = cA^z$$

$$S=cA^z_1 = z_{2 + x}$$



$$\backslash$$
$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# here is a new chunk of code, distant from the first one in our document.

z <- 1:10
print(z)

# end of the second chunk

```
